As your app might grow in size\n * and complexity, you will likely begin to split your reducers into separate\n * functions - with each one managing a separate slice of the state! This helper\n * function from 'redux' simply merges the reducers. Keep in mind we are using\n * the ES6 shorthand for property notation.\n *\n * If you're transitioning from Flux, you will notice we only use one store, but\n * instead of relying on multiple stores to manage diff parts of the state, we use\n * various reducers and combine them.\n *\n * More info: http://rackt.org/redux/docs/api/combineReducers.html\n */\nconst rootReducer = combineReducers({\n  gif,\n});\n\nexport default rootReducer;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/reducers/index.js","import {\n FETCH_GIFS_SUCCEEDED,\n FETCH_GIFS_FAILED,\n FETCH_REQUESTED,\n CLEAR_QUERY,\n INPUT_CHANGED,\n ENTER_PRESSED,\n BUTTON_CLICK,\n CLEAR_GIFS,\n ESC_PRESSED,\n CHANGE_LIGHTBOX\n} from '../constants/ActionTypes';\nimport fetch from 'isomorphic-fetch';\nimport { call, put, race, take, cancel, cancelled } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport { takeLatest, takeEvery, throttle } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { normalize, Schema, arrayOf } from 'normalizr';\nconst gif = new Schema('gif');\nconst pagination = new Schema('pagination');\n\nconst API_URL = \"https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?limit=100&api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC\";\n\nconst delay = (ms) => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms))\n\nconst buildUrl = (payload) => {\n  const {query, offset, other} = payload;\n  let apiString = API_URL;\n  apiString = other ?

Defaults to `(element) => element.clientHeight`\n * @param {function} [options.getWidth]  A function that is passed an element and returns element\n * width, where element is the wrapper div. Defaults to `(element) => element.clientWidth`\n * @param {object} [options.containerStyle] A style object for the `<div>` that will wrap your component.\n * The dimensions of this `div` are what are passed as props to your component. The default style is\n * `{ width: '100%', height: '100%', padding: 0, border: 0 }` which will cause the `div` to fill its\n * parent in most cases. If you are using a flexbox layout you will want to change this default style.\n * @param {string} [options.className] Control the class name set on the wrapper `<div>`\n * @param {boolean} [options.elementResize=false] Set true to watch the wrapper `div` for changes in\n * size which are not a result of window resizing - e.g. changes to the flexbox and other layout.\n * @return {function}                   A higher-order component that can be\n * used to enhance a react component `Dimensions()(MyComponent)`\n *\n * @example\n * // ES2015\n * import React from 'react'\n * import Dimensions from 'react-dimensions'\n *\n * class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n *   render() (\n *     <div\n *       containerWidth={this.props.containerWidth}\n *       containerHeight={this.props.containerHeight}\n *     >\n *     </div>\n *   )\n * }\n *\n * export default Dimensions()(MyComponent) // Enhanced component\n *\n * @example\n * // ES5\n * var React = require('react')\n * var Dimensions = require('react-dimensions')\n *\n * var MyComponent = React.createClass({\n *   render: function() {(\n *     <div\n *       containerWidth={this.props.containerWidth}\n *       containerHeight={this.props.containerHeight}\n *     >\n *     </div>\n *   )}\n * }\n *\n * module.exports = Dimensions()(MyComponent) // Enhanced component\n *\n */\nmodule.exports = function Dimensions() {\n  var _ref = arguments.length <= 0 || arguments[0] === undefined ?
